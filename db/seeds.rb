We will touch on these topics today but we will need more time than we have today! Plus, it will be helpful to revisit these concepts following the OOJS lecture!

Notice.create(title: "Additional Resource", description: "I have added this additional resource to the homeroom page. It is some info on getting started with your projects. You will see linked in that file a link to a repo with a sample file structure for your applications. The example has both frontend AND backend in a single repo (remember you can go back and watch the rails as an api study session to see this repo built out live!) You can also create two separate repositories - one for your frontend and one for your backend. REMINDER: your frontend and backend have NO inherent connection. The only thing that connects them in any way is when you make fetch requests. You could built out 100 applications that ALL make fetch requests to that same rails api. Think about any public api that you have used - there might be thousands of people building applications that request to that same API! In our case, you are building these apis specificlaly to serve your frontend but that does NOT “connect” them and it does not mean that you could not use that api to serve another frontend application, too! ALSO: do NOT be intimidated by the same rails/js projects that are linked on canvas. You are NOT expected to build out anything that huge! I have no doubts that all of you CAN but that would be a major feat in a week!", category: "Tips", user_id: 3)
